    <p><h3>Delicious vegetarian sauce for pasta, so tasty, and as nice as a meat bolognese. 
        It can also be served with potatoes.</h3></p>
        <p><h4>Step 1</h4></p>
        <p>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. 
            Cook and stir onion and garlic until soft, 
            about 5 minutes. Stir in red bell pepper and carrot; 
            cook for 4 to 5 minutes. 
            Add mushrooms; cook and stir until softened, 
            about 2 minutes.
        </p>
            <p><h4>Step 2</h4></p>
            <p>Pour wine into the pot; simmer until slightly reduced, 
                about 1 minute. 
                Stir in diced tomatoes and vegetable broth. 
                Bring sauce to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until 
                flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in lentils, 
                paprika, basil, oregano, dried herbs, 
                and nutmeg; cook until lentils are heated through, 
                about 5 minutes.
