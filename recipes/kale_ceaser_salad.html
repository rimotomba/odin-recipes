    <h1>Kale Ceaser Salad</h1>
    <img src="../Images/kale_ceaser_salad.webp">
    <p><h3>Traditional Caesar salad that uses kale instead of 
        romaine! Makes 4 side-dish portions, but you can make it a 
        main dish meal by topping it with a grilled protein, such as 
        chicken or salmon! You may have leftover dressing, depending 
        on how much you like. It keeps well in the refrigerator for 
        up to a week.</h3></p>
        <p><h4>Step 1</h4></p>
        <p>Place mayonnaise, lemon juice, garlic, anchovies, 
            Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and 
            pepper in the bowl of a food processor. Process 
            until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl and stir 
            in grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Set aside.
        </p>
            <p><h4>Step 2</h4></p>
            <p>Place kale in a large salad bowl. Using your hands, 
                massage the kale to soften slightly. Add a few 
                dollops of the dressing on top of the kale, and 
                stir until all pieces are lightly coated with the 
                dressing. Sprinkle with croutons and top with 
                shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
            </p>
